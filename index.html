      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>I'm a student from Southwest Michigan hoping to graduate in 2023. I currently live in Ann Arbor, and I'm taking classes in subjects such as human-computer interaction, web design, graphic design, and information systems.

      <h2>Experience</h2>
      <p>This website goes through some of my current projects I am working on, but I also have some past experience that has been enjoyable. In my senior year of high school, I did a year-long biochemistry research project called <i>Synthesis and Anticancer Activities of Boronic Acid Chalcones.</i> This project helped me understand a lot more about managing time independently as well as the importance of testing things out, which has helped me use an interative design process in my current work. 
      In other work experience, I have been a barista for over 4 years, which is a great way to learn customer service and teamwork as well.</p>

      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p>I enjoy cooking, baking, and playing tennis in my free time. I love cooking things that are comforting, like pastas or soups. Another way that I like to have fun with food is cheese boards-- they are perfect for eating, but also bringing friends and family together. I also have two dogs at home, Polaris and Siri, who love to stay active and play fetch. </p>
